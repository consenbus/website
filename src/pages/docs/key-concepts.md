### Introduction

Consenbus is a cryptocurrency that offers no fees, near-instant
transactions and extremely high scalability. Unlike traditional
cryptocurrencies which use blockchains, Consenbus uses a
**block dag** approach, in which each account has its own blockchain,
and only the account owner can modify its blockchain.

The usage of a block dag means that in order to complete a transaction,
the only parties who have to complete any work are the sender and the
receiver. This is a huge contrast to protocols like Bitcoin where the
global network has to agree on the state of each and every transaction,
resulting in huge energy costs and slow transactions.

There are many more details to be found in the
[official whitepaper](#), which is certainly worth reading,
but **          this documentation attempts to provide a much simpler, summarized
version of what's in the whitepaper that's more approachable to normal
programmers. It also includes a lot of details that, as far as I know,
are not documented anywhere else.
**Enjoy!

### Wallets

A **wallet** is a cryptographic data structure that contains an
arbitrary number of deterministically indexed accounts. A wallet has no
function or purpose other than holding accounts.

#### Seed

Each wallet is generated from the hash of a **seed**, a 64-byte
uppercase hex string (like`9F0E444C69F77A49BD0BE89DB92C38FE713E0963165CCA12FAF5712D7657120F`) that can be generated by a node or passed in by the user.
**          Anyone who has access to a wallet's seed can access all of its
accounts from any node in the network.
**
Therefore it's extremely important to safeguard your wallet seed in
order to ensure you that don't lose access to your account, and that
nobody else gains access to your account.

### Accounts

An account (also known as a frontier) is an entity in a wallet that is
able to send and receive transactions and retain a balance. Each account
has a 64-byte address (also known as an identifier) starting with
`bus_` and its own blockchain, which only the account holder
can modify. See [Blocks](http://localhost:8089/test.html#block) below to find out what
types of transactions accounts can make.

#### Index

Each account is generated deterministically from a **wallet seed**
and an **index**. For example, the seed
`          9F0E444C69F77A49BD0BE89DB92C38FE713E0963165CCA12FAF5712D7657120F
`
has the following addresses:

Index                 | Address
----------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------
0                     | `bus_3yiqftdf6t4s9nwhtpjpqr1sd5yinyupa3m54fh7c1mxy53bkpecczshr4uy`
1                     | `bus_3x3z1ak17y4edwccme1bkc9nrniy49moiumd1ernhh341ctm14ccsopkknnw`
⋮                     | ⋮
10<sup>19</sup> - 1   | `bus_1jw3tw7tsmkoexcgz4ubyzwqprsx3c9wkxuor5bb6oh8f5k81d9odhnh1ukj`


Many services that integrate Consenbus choose to assign a unique index
to each user of the service, thus giving each user their own unique
deposit address without any special processing required. A wallet can
hold up to 10<sup>19</sup> - 1 accounts, which should be enough for any
purpose.

#### Private key

An account's private key is used for offline signing of blocks.
**          Anyone with access to an account's private key can send and receive
transactions on behalf of that account from any node.
**

#### Public key

An account's public key is used to derive its address and as the initial
work hash for the account's open block (see below).

#### Opening an account

An account's first transaction must always be an **open** block. An
open block is like a receive block--it must have an accompanying
**send** transaction in order to be valid. In other words, you need
to send $BUS to an account's address before you can open it.

### Representatives

Representatives are accounts which cast votes in the case of a fork in
the network. Account holders who are unable to reliably participate in
voting for connectivity reasons can name a representative who can vote
with the weight of their balance, but do not otherwise have any access
to their funds. Each account may name one representative.
A good representative is a node that has high uptime (so it can
vote frequently) and a locally stored wallet containing accounts that
other users can delegate to. Maximizing the number and diversity of
representatives increases network resiliency.

#### Changing representatives

An account holder can change representatives any time by sending a
**change** block to the network.

### Blocks

A block represents a transaction made by an account in the network.
There are four types: **send**, **receive**, **open** and
**change**. All block types share a few common parameters:

COMMON PARAMETERS

col 1     | col 2
--------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
type      | The block's type (send, receive, open or change).
previous  | The hash of the previous block in the account's blockchain, or the account's public key if this is its first block.
work      | A [Proof of Work](http://localhost:8089/test.html#block-pow) hash generated based on the previous block's hash.
signature | A unique [ED25519](http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) (with [Blake2b](https://blake2.net/) digest) signature generated based on the block's contents that is easily verified.

#### Send block

A send block is used to send funds to another account. Once a send block
is published to the network, the amount in the send block is
irreversibly deducted from the balance of the sending account. A send is
considered to be "pocketed" when the receiving account publishes a
receive block (see below).

SPECIAL PARAMETERS

col 1   | col 2
------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
account | The identifier of the account to send funds to.
balance | The sending account's balance as of the previous block, in rawformat.
amount  | The amount of $BUS to send, in raw format.

#### Receive block

A receive block is used to complete (or "pocket") a transfer of value.
It is only valid if it's matched with a send block (source) addressed to
the receiving account.

SPECIAL PARAMETERS

col 1  | col 2
------ | --------------------------------------------------
source | The hash of the send block that is being received.

EXAMPLE BLOCK

col 1     | col 2
--------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
type      | `receive`
source    | `DED555CE596E54F783424BA3DEC0B6EEF26E9E865DE1FCA3B58264555FC184E8`
previous  | `81D04E3188A5E8CF6BD98BBE836156B4CA0E395D3188AAF1BA20A15172E375D2`

signature | `                1BD5AFE968F37C1FDA96B0C2CB5381377BD2CAD4D6D6331B6160B304F6A1C54076DAB885EF4DC1F0BB79AE7B58575140BEF709E32D8A1DCD5D4210684C567E0C`

#### Open block

An open block is used to open account and is functionally the same as a
receive block. An open block must be the first block in every account's
blockchain, and must name the account's representative.

SPECIAL PARAMETERS

col 1          | col 2
-------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
source         | The hash of the send block that is being received.
representative | The account identifier of the representative that this account will delegate to (can be its own identifier).

-------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
type           | `open`
source         | `69161915A1715B26BE22C7BD8DBFA4A282D0CDC09AA45552773FB42581263C2A`

#### Change block

A change block is used to change an account's representative. There is
no cost associated with this action.

SPECIAL PARAMETERS

col 1          | col 2
-------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
representative | The account identifier of the new representative that this account will delegate to (can be its own identifier).

EXAMPLE BLOCK

col 1          | col 2

representative | `bus_3pczxuorp48td8645bs3m6c3xotxd3idskrenmi65rbrga5zmkemzhwkaznh`
work           | `fe7cb9eeb491ddbb`
signature      | `                F9EF13E84621386C6182B7CBE40D88EC518E3A6F8509B0AE0E7402C2DF161C22CF515BA148CDB62D18046329A34D86DEBA448240330DF5B5CED6BB80420C3204`

#### Proof of Work

As an anti-spam measure, each block published to the network must
include a valid **work** parameter, which is an 8-byte [Blake2b](https://blake2.net/)
hash that is computed from the hash of the most recent block in the
account's blockchain (or the account's public key, if the account has no
blocks yet).

The Proof of Work algorithm works by iterating through random 32-bit
integers concatenated with the hash of the most recent block until the
Blake2b hash is below a certain work threshold agreed upon by all nodes
in the network.

Proof of Work is not meant to take a long time--it can take as little as
0.2 seconds on average on the fastest GPUs available in early 2018. It
is simply meant to prevent abuse of the network. Since every block an
account publishes must include work generated from the previous block's
hash, an account can send a maximum of 5 transactions per second with
high-end hardware.
